# nba_stat_leader_all_stars

From 2019-2020

I'm a Hawks fan so is definitely biased towards Trae Young. I've seen a lot of recent comparisons between Trae Young's stats and those of Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. All of them have good stats but Trae Young is currently top 5 in points and assists per game, so I wanted to look up two things:

How often there are NBA players who are top 5 in PTS and top 5 in REB/AST? And do how often do these NBA players make the all star game?

Using [this](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) python API and a table of yearly all-stars built from this wikipedia link, I found out a few things.

Since 1951, there have been 111 players who ended up top 5 in the NBA in points as well as top 5 in rebounds/assists. It seems like there's only been one player who hasn't made the All-Star game under these conditions. Nate Archibald in 1971-1972 ended up 2nd in the NBA with 28.2 PPG and 3rd in the NBA with 9.2 APG and didn't make the All-Star game. This was probably had something to do with the two following reasons: he averaged 23.7 before the all-star break and 33.8 after, and he split time as a starter and a reserve that season. All other 110 players were all-stars.

Another random fact: only one player has been top 5 in PTS, REB, and AST in an NBA season. It was Wilt Chamberlain, who did it 3 times in 1963-64, 1966-67, and 1967-68.
